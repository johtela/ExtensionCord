# ExtensionCord - Useful Extensions for .NET Types

This assembly contains useful extension methods for standard .NET types and some simple 
helper classes. It is an assortment of code that I tend to reuse in most of my projects.
So, instead of copying that code around, I collected it into a single shared assembly.

## Installation

The latest version of the library can be installed as a 
[Nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ExtensionCord) from [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/).
The library targets .NET standard 1.0, so it works with practically all .NET implementations.
